Python got it's name from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s, as Guido van Rossum was reading the published scripts at the time.\n",

The simplicity of Python compared to other programming languages to the complete beginner will likely come as a pleasant surprise. Python has simple **<font color=\"red\">syntax</font>** which makes reading written code closer to the english language. Python is also structured so it requires fewer lines of code and easier to work out what each line is doing. In addition to it's relative ease of use, Python's versatility means you can conduct a huge variety of tasks, such as:\n",
